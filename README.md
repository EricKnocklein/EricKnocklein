# Hi, I'm Eric Knocklein
[Website](https://ericknock.dev/) • [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-knocklein-592a331b5/)

I'm a software engineer with a passion in applying the technical knowledge I've over the course of my education and my career in whatever interesting creative ideas strike my fancy. In my repos, you will find a large variety of projects from a [tool to build portfolio websites](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/portfolio_template) to a [chrome extension to turn on some features of a worldbuilding website](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/WaSpellcheck) to [an exploration of temporal gradients in a particle simulation](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/stochastish-gravity).

For a full overview of my work and my professional career, feel free to visit my [personal website](https://ericknock.dev/).

## Currently Working On
- A Medium article that adapts my interactive stochastic gravity article
- Revisiting a family tree project that uses animated SVGs. The first version can be found [here](https://mardtree.netlify.app/index2.html), but I'm making serious improvements to it at the moment.

## Projects
- **[Stochastic Particle Simulation](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/stochastish-gravity)**: An exploration of how local differences in the speed of updating particles gives a global force similar to gravity in a particle simulation. Plushed as an [interactive article](https://ericknock.dev/gravity/).
- **[CSS Book Animation](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/animated_book_css)**: Uses 3D transforms to create an openable book that displays arbitrary HTML content. You can find an example of this component being used in practice on my [author's website](https://eklittlehill.com/), where I use the component as a mock-up for a short book I wrote.
- **[World Anvil Spell Check Override Chrome Extension](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/WaSpellcheck)**: I use World Anvil a lor for my personal projects, and they had an update that remove spell-checking from one of their editors, so I wrote a simple chrome extension to put it back.
- **[Portfolio Template](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/portfolio_template)**: When I was creating my personal website, I decided to publish the React components so that others could easily create a similar portfolio site.
- **[Wiki Reading Order](https://github.com/EricKnocklein/Algorithmic-Reading-Order-2)**: Python code to organize a wiki into a reading order using an adapted topological sort algorithm. There are also [2 YouTube videos](https://ericknock.dev/projects/graph%20analysis) to go along with this repo and part 1 of this repo.

## Other Work
Throughout my coding-related projects, you can find a common theme: most of my interests are aligned with a larger writing and worldbuilding project that I have been working on for many years. For this I have drawn many [blackwork drawings](https://ericknock.dev/projects/blackwork), I have written, and I have created countless private articles and notes. For an almost complete list of published works, see [the catalog page on my author's website](https://eklittlehill.com/catalog).
